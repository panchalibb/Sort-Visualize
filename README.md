# Sort-Visualize
Objective: The goal is to visualize the process of sorting an array using a sorting algorithm. In this case, we used the Bubble Sort algorithm.

Sorting Algorithm (Bubble Sort): Bubble Sort repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.This process is repeated until the array is sted.

Visualization:The code prints the array after every swap, showing how the elements are gradually sorted. A brief delay is added after each step to make the changes observable, simulating the sorting process.

Learning Outcome:This visualization helps in understanding how sorting algorithms work step-by-step, making it easier to grasp the concept of sorting in data structures.
